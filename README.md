# 🧠 Predictive Lead Conversion Using Metadata

This project is a part of the **Intel® AI for Manufacturing Certification Course**, supported by **Intel, GCCI, and the Digital Readiness Team**. The goal of this project is to build an AI-based solution that predicts whether a potential lead will convert based on historical user metadata such as browsing behavior, traffic source, and engagement patterns.

## 📌 Project Description

Lead conversion rates are often low despite high traffic on websites. Using machine learning, this project analyzes various lead features (such as time spent on site, page visits, device used, and source) to predict the likelihood of conversion. This helps optimize digital marketing strategies by prioritizing high-probability leads.

## 🚀 Live App Deployment

Access the deployed web application below:

🔗 [https://predictive-lead-conversion.streamlit.app](https://predictive-lead-conversion.streamlit.app)

Simply enter sample lead engagement data into the app and receive an instant prediction on whether that lead is likely to convert.
